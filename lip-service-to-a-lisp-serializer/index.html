<h3 id="lisp-in-the-sky-with-diamonds">Lisp in the Sky with Diamonds</h3>
<p>That what you witnessed above, is not real Lisp.
Or at least it was not produced by real Lisp&hellip;</p>
<p>I confess, I have been experimenting with <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> again.
This time I started by visiting the website of <a href="https://serde.rs/">Serde</a>.
When I landed on the homepage I saw a list of data formats implemented for Serde.
I recognized many names, all the many that I have used before.
But one stood out to me, this one was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression">S-Expression</a> format.
I have heard of its potency;
I have heard that it can make you understand, things you have never understood before.</p>
<p>I took a handfull of parentheses, and I took them whole.
When the lights went finally out, I experienced the highest of intellectual highs.
The realm of computation is a wonderous plain, and one day you will find it too.</p>
<h3 id="s-expressions">S-Expressions</h3>
<p>So, I have discovered S-Expressions as (de)serialized by Rust&rsquo;s Serde.
S-Expressions are the symbolic form of Lisp objects, similair to what <a href="https://www.json.org/json-en.html">JSON</a> is to JavaScript.
But while JSON objects are primarily for data, S-Expressions can also be used for <em>code</em>.
Which means that S-Expressions can be used to create small/domain-specific programming languages,
to implement various forms of automata,
or to use as syntactically interesting key/value stores.</p>
<h3 id="rusty-calculators">Rusty calculators</h3>
<p>I will continue this experiment, and see if I can write a language that can do basic arithmatic.
About which I will undoubtedly write about.</p>
<p>For now get yourself a copy of <a href="https://github.com/rotty/lexpr-rs">lexpr-rs</a>, and see where it will take you.</p>
